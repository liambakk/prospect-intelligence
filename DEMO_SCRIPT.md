## Opening (30 seconds)
"Hi! I'm excited to show you something I built specifically for ModelML's sales team. 

After researching ModelML, I realized your biggest sales challenge isn't closing deals - it's qualifying prospects efficiently. Manual research takes hours per company.

So I built a tool that automates this entire process using AI - just like ModelML does for your clients."

## Live Demo (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Introduction
"This is the Prospect Intelligence Tool - designed to match ModelML's brand and values."

*Point out ModelML-inspired design elements*

### Step 2: First Analysis
"Let's analyze JPMorgan Chase - a perfect ModelML prospect."

*Type: JPMorgan Chase*
*Click: Analyze Company*

"Watch how we gather data from multiple sources in real-time..."

*As progress bar fills:*
- "Enriching company data..."
- "Scanning job postings for AI roles..."
- "Analyzing recent news and initiatives..."
- "Evaluating their website for AI signals..."

### Step 3: Results Review

**AI Readiness Score**
"JPMorgan scores 89 out of 100 - they're in the 'Very High' readiness category.

This isn't arbitrary - it's based on 5 weighted factors:
- They have 89 open AI/ML positions
- 14 recent AI news articles
- Advanced digital maturity
- Financial services has 75% industry AI adoption
- Modern tech stack with Python, Kubernetes, Cloud"

**Decision Makers**
"We've identified Lori Beer, their Global CIO, and Marco Pistoia, Head of AI Research.

Notice the customized approach for each person - Lori needs enterprise scale discussion, Marco wants cutting-edge capabilities."

**Sales Approach**
"The tool recommends an 'Advanced Partnership' strategy with specific talking points:
- They're already investing heavily in AI
- ModelML can be their next evolution
- Focus on competitive advantage

And actionable next steps:
- Schedule executive briefing within 1 week
- Prepare custom demo with their use cases"

### Step 4: Generate Report
"Everything exports to a professional PDF report..."

*Click: Generate PDF Report*

"Your sales team can share this with prospects or use it internally."

## Value Proposition (1 minute)

### Speed Comparison
"What normally takes a sales rep 2-3 hours of research across LinkedIn, news sites, and databases - we do in 30 seconds."

### Try Another Company
"Let's try Goldman Sachs..."

*Quick demo of Goldman - scores 82*

"Different score, different approach - the tool adapts to each prospect's readiness level."

### Scalability
"Imagine running this on your entire prospect list. You'd instantly know:
- Who to prioritize
- How to approach each company
- What objections to expect
- Which decision makers to target"

## Technical Highlights (30 seconds)

"Built with:
- Python and Flask for the backend
- ModelML's design language for the UI
- Multiple data source integration
- Custom scoring algorithm based on real financial services data
